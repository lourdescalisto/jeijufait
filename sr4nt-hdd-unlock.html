Replacement Hard Drives or SSD's in an iMac cause the HDD Fan to run at full speed. Unlike other Fan Control Software, HDD Fan Control completely controls the fan speed making it run correctly again. I salvaged a HDD from an old laptop and it's password protected, so Windows doesn't recognize it in the Device Manager. The HDD itself can be seen in the BIOS, though its password cannot be changed b/c of different OEMs. Intel RST recognizes it as a locked drive within the OS. edit I have the old drive connected to my desktop via SATA. Both the old drive and my desktop have Windows 7 installed. Thus far, I know that Intel RST has the capacity to do this for me, but to enable it would require.

Do not ask me to help you, I won’t and can’t, those who still ask will be haunted Hello guys, I've heard stories about how people's laptops and hard drives are taken for inspection in customs. I heard they check for porn (esp. pedo stuff) and pirated software. I don't have any pedo stuff but dem softwares.well. Anyway, want to know if this still happens in recent times (2019). Any recent experiences are very welcome. FYI I am an 20ish Asian male traveling with 27ish Asian sister to Sydney for uni in February 2019. Country of origin is Myanmar. Suspicious. Если удаление все равно происходит с ошибкой, то, возможно, какой-то процесс Windows использует накопитель и поэтому невозможно получить доступ к файловой системе и она не будет отформатирована.

Lockable (Required) This indicates if the drive has "ATA Security Mode", or if you prefer the casual "Lockability". ConfigMagic, Evox, eepromer, unlockx, hdlock, are some of the programs able to lock or unlock a drive. So I softmodded my xbox and installed the XBMC Dashboard and made a backup of both my eeprom and the MS Dashboard connected through FTP and accidentally deleted the XBMC folder on the xbox HDD, though luckily before doing that I had the foresight to backup the C, D, E, and Q partitions on my Mac so everything is good there at least. Now every time I turn the xbox on I get either error codes 13 or 14 it can still play games no problem I looked for solutions on google and one option So my ethernet port stopped working on my X3 modded Xbox. Everything else still functions fine, though. My plan is just to swap out my v1.1 motherboard with a v1.0 that I got on eBay. Been a long time, but I assume I need to get the HDD unlock codes or backup the EEPROM since I'm going to use my old 250 gb HDD. Was there anything else necessary and does updating my new motherboard with the old unlock codes mean the Xbox would not get banned if connecting to Xbox Live. I'm doing a cheap laptop refresh (small company) by upgrading all to ssd's as well as memory upgrades. Does anyone know if booting from a cloned disk will trigger the TPM? My hunch is yes but we also have the recovery keys in AD so if they do lock, can i just recovery and re reset the TPM settings with the new drive? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Hi all, I received a free(!) rev 1.0 Xbox from a friend of mine, but it shows the error 21. I asked what happened and he had the xbox soft-modded via the Splinter Cell exploit. It worked great and he wanted to customize the xbox and change the audio files with his own files. After replacing a file (he doesnt know which), error 21 pops-up and he never looked at it again. When the Xbox boots-up you see the Xbox logo and immediately error 21, so it's not possible to get into the dashboard. First time jailbreaking PS3s here, everything worked fine, I used the NOR tool to jailbreak and loaded up rebug. I installed PSNPatch, and went to setup the startup plugin. This is where the problems started: System rebooted and then froze after 10 seconds, requiring a hard reboot, which I did by holding the power button. Holding Select + L2 + R3 + L3 on bootup did not disable PSNPatch, and so I went to the Recovery Menu to restore filesystem. Hitting X on Restore File System Hi, I want to upgrade the HDD of my softmodded xbox to a "new" used one. I tried the hotswap method with JCRocky5's Chimp 261812 build and this guide from the wiki (https://www.reddit.com/r/originalxbox/wiki/chimp), but when I start chimp, it tells me after the initial boot sequence that my slave drive is locked and I need to unlock it first. Trying to unlock the slave drive in the chimp options doesn't do anything (I tried all of them). I am pretty much a complete noob with these kinds Explain why to "softmod" the Xbox, the HD has to be removed while running and reconnected to the utility PC, still running. What, exactly, does "unlocked" mean? Why can't the HD be put into an "unlocked" state and then simply pull the power cord from the Xbox to allow the drive to be moved to the utility PC safely? amp#x200B. Especially since a lot of times you sit on a players needed screen for minutes and when finally you have enough players, you still have to wait 60 seconds, which is more time for others to get frustrated and then quit, and back to players needed again. 
I have an xbox v1.0 with an error 7. I have the eeprom file saved. I can't for the life of me get hdm2.2 to write me a factory reset HDD. I don't know what I'm doing wrong at this point. I just want to go back to factory dash, so I can soft mod and then flash (solder points already done). I managed to tsop flash my other xbox, put a new HDD in it, and got it going. Now I'm trying to rewrite the working xbox's original HDD back to factory, with the broken one's eeprom. First I tried unlocking. got the game on steam. supposedly my save file is on the cloud. i just formatted my pc (whent from regular HDD to SSD and needed to change bios settings that wont let me just clone the disk needed to reinstall) ALL my games are on a sepparated usb external disk. once i reinstalled steam, reconnected the game location to steam storage, and now my save file is GONE. anyone can assist. Hello, ​I'm struggling to erase a Samsung PM851 M.2 SSD using the PSID revert tool. To be used as a big and fast USB-stick I bought a used SSD, that is encrypted with unknown password. I knew the drive is OPAL compliant and the PSID is printed on the drive, so I thought it shouldn't be an issue to erase the drive with https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/PSID-Revert (https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/PSID-Revert) As I don't own a computer So I’m using Windows 10 bitlocker feature without a TPM (its all software). The drive is encrypted successfully and it’s worked just fine for over a year (it always asked me to type in a password specifically for decrypting the drive like it’s supposed to.) Lately, however, sometimes when I boot up my machine it doesn’t ask me for the bitlocker password. It just boots straight to the PIN. The first time I thought maybe my brain was fucking up cause I thought that was literally impossible. The mags are nowhere to be found, he doesn't trade 2 HDDs for a mag at Prapor level 3 anymore and to get Prapor level 4 before that task to buy them you need level 33 and 0.50 standing which you can only get by then if you buy EOD because it gives 0.20 standing to begin with EDIT: People say you can still trade HDDs for mags at level 3, but honestly the amount is too low if they are gone 10 minutes into the trader reset, 40 minutes in and prapor still trades AKs for blackrocks here is the thing. I locked my original xbox hdd from the dashboard of the console (dont ask why I just didnt know about it back then) Then a few days later I connected my xbox via ethernet to modify a path in the C drive (I was trying to change the boot up screen from evolution x to another one), but it didnt work. So now when I turn on my xbox (by holding the power button for 3 seconddes and thus turning on the chip) it freezes before it boots evolution x (xcuter 2 is written

After hotswapping, I tried to start sending games to the Xbox via FTP. A few games did work, but eventually, the transfer stopped. I aborted the transfer, rebooted the Xbox, and it worked as it should until when it would usually show the UnleashX logo, the light goes from orange to the red/green flashing. Nothing is displayed. Any idea what the problem is or how I could </p>
